# 🧰 Playbooks

{{< hint info >}}
**ℹ️ Info**

Playbooks are a collection of tasks that are executed in sequence. They are useful for running a set of tasks that are related to each other. For example, you might have a playbook that installs a set of packages, and another playbook that runs a set of commands that are dependent on the packages being installed.

For usage and configuration details, see the individual playbook page. Here are some of the playbooks that I have written:

* [🕳️ Pi-Hole](/plays/pi-hole "setup and configure pi-hole") - A playbook to install and configure [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/)
* [🗄️ Pi-Server](/plays/pi-server "setup a basic raspberrypi server") - A playbook to install and configure simple server
<!-- * [0️⃣ One](/plays/ "") -->
